/* 游부游부游부 Request 3: .filter() 游부游부游부
The zoo is concerned about animals with a lower population count. 
Using lowPopulationAnimals use .filter() to create a new array of objects which contains only the animals with a population of less than 5.

/* 游부游부游부 Request 4: .reduce() 游부游부游부
The zoo needs to know their total animal population across the United States. 
Using USApop find the total population from the zoos array using the .reduce() method. 
Remember the reduce method takes two arguments: a callback (which itself takes two args - the accumulator and the item), and an initial value for the count.
